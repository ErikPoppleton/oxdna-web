                                Welcome to oxDNA.org, a service of the Sulc and Yan labs at Arizona State University.  Our goal is to facilitate development of more advance and complex
                                designs in the fields of DNA and RNA nanotechnology by facilitating non-experts to run simple simulations.
                                The simulations this server supports are equlibrium sampling of assembled designs, meant to 
                                assist users in understanding the dynamics of their designs before taking them to the lab.

                                Simulation FAQ:
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                <b>How large of structures can I simulate?</b>  
                                These simulations are run on NVIDIA 2080 RTX GPUs, which easily handle origami-sized (10-20k bases) designs.
                                Designs with more than 50k bases may not finish in the time allotted to each job. <br>
                                <b>Can I submit my own oxDNA input files?</b>  
                                For security reasons, we do not allow users to submit their own input files. <br>
                                <b>Can I run VMMC/FFS/PT/Umbrella sampling simulations?</b>
                                No. This service is meant to provide simulation support for experimental labs and so only provides equlibrium MD simulations. <br>
                                <b>How do I get my design into oxDNA format?</b> The <a href="http://tacoxdna.sissa.it/">TacoxDNA webserver</a>
                                provides a variety of conversion tools from popular DNA nanotechnology design platforms to the oxDNA format.  Some tools, such as vHelix 
                                and MagicDNA have built in oxDNA outputs.  Designs from CaDNAno often need to be relaxed using rigid-body dynamics prior to simulation, 
                                this can be done in <a href="https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna-viewer">oxView</a> (hit the "try it!" link in the description). <br>
                                <b>What is the real-time correlation of these simulations?</b> Coarse-grained simulations such as oxDNA speed up different processes
                                by different amounts.  These simulations will be run for 1e9 steps with a timestep of 0.001, which by conservative estimation corresponds
                                to 3.03 &mu;s.  However, based on simulated rates of hairpin hybridization, this corresponds to an actual timescale on the order of 1 ms. <br>
                                <b>My simulation log shows an error!  What do I do??</b> Errors are most frequently due to the model encountering unpysical states because of
                                insufficient relaxation.  Structures exported from design tools are rarely in a physically viable state and must be relaxed prior to production
                                simulation.  We have tried to provide a reasonable relaxation protocol automatically, but for some structures it is insufficient.
                                  Try resubmitting your job and increasing the length of the relaxation steps or decreasing the dt of the MD relaxation. <br>
                                <b>I am interested in learning more about oxDNA!  Where can I do that?</b> Check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05052.pdf">book chapter</a> for a comprehensive introduction 
                                and take a look at the <a href="https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page">documentation</a> for detailed information on installation and running simulations.<br>

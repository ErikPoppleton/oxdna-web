- Move file downloads to Nginx
- Use proper templating in Flask so sidebar is dynamic!
- Run production version of Flask server
- Only allow analysis jobs to be ran after main job has finished
- Show progress of analysis jobs
- I really wish "verified" or whatever was a BOOL type in the MySQL table
- Would be nice to have all Slurm interfacing abstracted to a Slurm.py class
- Account.py clean-up
- EmailScript.py redo+clean-up
- Integrity constraints on cross-table references to ensure the state of the database is always consistent (users->user_id->jobs) for example
- Move auths, and directories to ENV variables (for example "/users" folder)
- Rename DB column, change Job->Analyses relational representation so that analyses/offspring jobs point to their parent
